**For running this project**,
navigate to the travel-agency folder, open terminal and type "npm install" which will install the required files and dependencies. After that, type "npm run dev" and it will run the project. When the search button will be clicked the flight data will be fetched. As json was local, i didn't use any fetch or axios method.
