**For running this project**,
navigate to the travel-agency folder, open terminal and type "npm install" which will install the required files and dependencies. After that, type "npm run dev" and it will run the project. When the search button will be clicked the flight data will be fetched. As json was local, i didn't use any fetch or axios method.

**As for the best practices,**

1. I used component best architecture, so specific folders along with specific component and css file were created so that they are independent.
2. Descriptive and meaningful names were used.
3. Code comments are present where the logics are complicated.
4. Codes are organized in smaller and reusable component which is for modularity.

**I have spent about 6-7 hours completing this project**
